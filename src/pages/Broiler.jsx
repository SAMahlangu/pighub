        <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p><strong>Pigs Overview</strong></p>
          <p>
            Pigs, also known as swine or hogs, are intelligent, social mammals belonging to a scientific family called <i>Sus Scrofa</i>. 
            Originating from Africa, Europe, and Asia, pigs have distinctive physical characteristics including a special snout, curly tail, 
            short legs, and varied sizes ranging from 50 to 600 kg and colors such as white, black, brown, and pink. 
            With over 100 breeds, pigs serve multiple purposes. They are raised for meat (pork), used for leather, medicine, 
            and are popular farm animals or even kept as pets.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Starting a Pig Farm</strong></p>
          <p>
            Starting a pig farm involves careful planning and consideration of several key factors to ensure the success 
            and sustainability of the venture:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Location and Farm Site:</strong> Ensure the farm is near a road and easily accessible.</li>
            <li><strong>Breed Selection:</strong> Choose breeds suitable for your local conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Feeding and Nutrition:</strong> Supply high-quality feed with at least the required crude protein to meet the 
                nutritional needs of pigs at different stages of growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Veterinary Care:</strong> Access to veterinary care is important for the health and well-being of the pigs.</li>
            <li><strong>Housing and Facilities:</strong> Build pens that provide enough space and proper shelter for the pigs.</li>
          </ul>
      </div>

      {/* The Pig Production System section */}
      <div className="broiler-section" ref={infrastructureRef}>
      <h2>Pig Production Systems</h2>
        <p>
          Pig production systems vary significantly, ranging from large-scale commercial operations to small-scale farming, each with its own methods and practices. Let's explore these systems in detail, with a particular emphasis on small-scale farming.
        </p>
        <h3>Large-Scale Commercial Pig Production</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Modern Facilities: Large farms invest in advanced housing systems with controlled environments to optimize growth and health.</li>
          <li>Specialized Diets: Pigs are fed scientifically formulated diets to meet their nutritional needs precisely, ensuring rapid growth and high productivity.</li>
          <li>Health Management: Comprehensive health programs, including regular vaccinations and biosecurity measures, are in place to prevent disease outbreaks.</li>
          <li>Technological Integration: Use of technology for monitoring animal health, feed consumption, and overall farm management.</li>
          <li>High Investment: Significant capital investment in infrastructure, equipment, and technology to maximize efficiency and production scale.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Small-Scale Pig Farming</h3>
        <p>
          Small-scale pig farming, often practiced by smallholder farmers, involves simpler, more traditional methods. Here, the focus is on sustainability and local practices. Key aspects include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Low-Cost Setup: Small-scale farmers typically use locally available materials to build pig pens, reducing initial investment costs.</li>
          <li>Feed Sources: Pigs are often fed a mix of homegrown feed, agricultural byproducts, and kitchen scraps. This reduces feed costs and utilizes available resources effectively.</li>
          <li>Labor-Intensive: Farming is more labour-intensive, with family members often involved in daily care and management of the pigs.</li>
          <li>Diverse Breeds: Small farms might keep various pig breeds, including indigenous ones, which are well-adapted to local conditions.</li>
          <li>Community Integration: Small-scale pig farming is often integrated into the local community, with farmers exchanging knowledge and resources.</li>
          <li>Sustainable Practices: Emphasis on recycling waste, such as using pig manure as fertilizer, and practicing crop-livestock integration.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Benefits of Small-Scale Pig Farming</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Economic Opportunity: Provides a source of income for rural families and can be a step towards poverty alleviation.</li>
          <li>Food Security: Contributes to local food supply, providing meat for household consumption and local markets.</li>
          <li>Flexibility: Small-scale farms can be more adaptable to changing market conditions and environmental challenges.</li>
          <li>Cultural Significance: Preserves traditional farming practices and local breeds, which are part of cultural heritage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Challenges for Small-Scale Pig Farming</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Limited Resources: Small farmers often have limited access to capital, veterinary services, and modern technology.</li>
          <li>Disease Management: Due to fewer resources, small-scale farms may face challenges in controlling diseases and maintaining biosecurity.</li>
          <li>Market Access: Small-scale farmers might struggle with accessing larger markets and securing fair prices for their products.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          While large-scale pig production focuses on efficiency and volume through advanced technology and significant investments, small-scale pig farming prioritizes sustainability, local resource use, and community involvement. Both systems play vital roles in the agricultural landscape, but small-scale farming remains crucial for rural development and food security.
        </p>

        <h4>Key Practices in Small-Scale Farming</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Free range to scavenge for food: Practiced by small farmers mainly in rural areas where pigs are fed mostly grass, brewery, cereal by-products, or waste products/food.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tethered or confined in a backyard or village: This permits control of the pigs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Kitchen Swills and Crop by-products: A system popular in Africa, Asia, and South America.
          </li>
          <li>
            Small, Medium, or Large Commercial Units: Highly intensive systems with technical control over environmental stress.
          </li>
          <li>
            Intensive Pig Farming: Conventional structures handle everything from breeding to raising pregnant pigs.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div className="broiler-section" ref={equipmentRef}>
  <h2>Building a Structure for the Pigs</h2>
  <p>
    You need to decide on how many pigs you wish to farm with, as it will determine the size of your structure. You must choose between free-range pig farming or housing the pigs in pens, which will also impact the cost of your materials. Whether you build your own building or buy a house for your pigs, it is preferable to build your own structure. 
    Biosecurity and welfare considerations must be incorporated into the structure design and adhered to.

  <h3>Building a Pig House</h3>
  <p>
    To build a pig house, you will need:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Wooden or metal frame</li>
    <li>Roofing (e.g., iron sheets)</li>
    <li>Walls (wood, brick, or concrete)</li>
    <li>Flooring</li>
    <li>Fencing</li>
    <li>Doors and windows</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Steps to Build the Pig House</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Prepare a flat site with adequate drainage.</li>
    <li>Build a frame (1.5-2m high).</li>
    <li>Add flooring and walls.</li>
    <li>Install doors and windows.</li>
    <li>Fence the enclosure.</li>
    <li>Finish the interior with bedding, feeding, and watering setups.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Key Considerations for Pig Housing</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Pigs spend most of their time outdoors.</li>
    <li>Pigs must have room to move, exercise, and forage.</li>
    <li>Pigs should be exposed to sunlight.</li>
    <li>Pigs need fresh air for proper breathing.</li>
    <li>No cages or crates should be used.</li>
    <li>Pigs like to graze on pasture.</li>
  </ul>
        </div>


      {/* The PIG, MATING AND SELECTION section */}
      <div className="broiler-section" ref={lightingRef}>
      <h2>Pig, mating and selection</h2>
      <div className="breeding-info">
        <p>
          <strong>Breeding Pigs:</strong> To start breeding, get a male pig (boar) and a female pig (sow) and put them together in a pig house. The boar will mount the sow when she is ready, and they will have multiple babies. This process occurs when the sow is in heat.
        </p>

        <h3>When Does a Sow Get Ready?</h3>
        <p>
          The sow is ready to mate every 21 days for 2 to 3 days. After mating, the sow is pregnant for approximately 114 days and then gives birth to baby pigs. As a farmer, you can expect 8 to 12 baby pigs from each pregnant sow. First-time mothers tend to have fewer babies. To ensure more babies, make sure the pigs are healthy, well-fed, and happy. Some baby pigs may not survive (mortality). With good care, 10 pigs can produce up to 250 babies a year, though this number may vary.
        </p>

        <h4>Understanding Mortality</h4>
        <p>
          Mortality refers to the death rate and can affect baby pigs, adults, and unborn animals. Common causes of death in pigs include diseases, accidents, poor nutrition, bad environmental conditions, and genetics. Tracking mortality helps identify health issues, prevent future deaths, improve animal care, reduce losses, and enhance farm management.
        </p>
        <p>
          To reduce mortality, farmers can:
          <ul>
            <li>Vaccinate pigs to protect against diseases</li>
            <li>Provide nutritious food</li>
            <li>Maintain clean and comfortable living conditions</li>
            <li>Offer regular care and health checks</li>
            <li>Choose strong genetics when breeding</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          By understanding and addressing mortality, farmers can promote healthier pigs and improve farm productivity.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>What Happens After a Pig Gives Birth?</h3>
      <p>
        After giving birth, the sow takes care of her piglets, and the farmer helps by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Providing food and water for the sow and piglets</li>
        <li>Keeping their living space clean and warm</li>
        <li>Checking for healthy piglets and assisting weak ones</li>
        <li>Giving vaccinations to protect against diseases</li>
        <li>Tagging or marking piglets for identification</li>
        <li>Weaning piglets from the sow after 3 to 4 weeks</li>
        <li>Moving piglets to a nursery area for growth and care</li>
        <li>Monitoring their health, growth, and behavior</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This care ensures that piglets grow strong and healthy, setting them up for the next stage of their lives.
      </p>

      <h4>Why Is Weaning Important?</h4>
      <p>
        Weaning reduces stress for the sow, allowing her to rest and prepare for her next pregnancy. It also helps the piglets grow independently and prepares them for their next stage of life. Proper weaning practices are essential for maintaining a healthy and productive pig farm.
